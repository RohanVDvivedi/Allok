 * single initilization using pthread_once_t for Allok and set static global variable allok_initialized
 * fail allok() and freek() calls if the allocator is uninitialized
 * enable allok_init() function to set a the page size of the allocator (<4096 result in 8KB pages) and ensure that it is always a multiple of 4096.

 * create a malloc shim for the library, to use it with regular programs.

 * modify test cases to run in multiple runs to visualize allocation (merges and splits) using debug statments, to increase test coverage
